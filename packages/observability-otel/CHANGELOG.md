### Patch Changes

- @anvia/core@1.0.1

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4564d2f: Prepare the synchronized Anvia 1.0 release train.

### Patch Changes

- 475ae22: Replace process-local approval continuations and Studio-only questions with JSON-safe Agent
  interactions resumed through `generate()` or `stream()`. Add first-class question tools, explicit
  interaction response message parts, linked phase-local runs, suspension-aware nested composition,
  queued steering receipts, and eval responders. Upgrade the Client protocol to v3, unify React and
  Studio interaction handling, preserve suspensions through memory, traces, and resumable streams,
  and reject unresolved interaction parts at provider boundaries.
- 45882ab: Replace Agent status results with explicit `response`, `interaction`, and `blocked` outcomes. Add
  `Agent.resume()` and a stream handle exposing events, text deltas, final text and outcome promises,
  steering, and cancellation. Flatten terminal Agent stream outcomes instead of wrapping them in a
  `final` event, and migrate Studio, client adapters, and observability integrations to the new API.
- 640dd3c: Redesign observability around named Agent observers, explicit primary trace provenance, and
  object-only eval targets and reporter error policies. Add owned, lazy, asynchronously disposable
  Langfuse and Lens clients; make OpenTelemetry and logger observers lifecycle-free registrations;
  and preserve observer identity through client streams and Studio traces.
  Eval trace resolution now preserves observer provenance, and reporters reject traces owned by a
  different backend unless explicitly mapped. Langfuse clients use isolated tracer providers, and
  strict observer startup/terminal dispatch cleans up partial starts without duplicate terminal calls.
- a4bf9d2: Bind provider and local-model handles to explicit model IDs, make remote provider factories
  object-only, and introduce honest local loading and ownership boundaries.
- 3d2fd23: Replace message factories with strict JSON-safe structural messages, add canonical Core and UI
  parsers, move custom data validation to typed transports, and adopt the `anvia.client.v2` framed
  protocol. Make Client and Server calls object-only, make React transport-only with standalone
  completion state, and require canonical structural message requests in Studio.
- 4ab25bb: Expose `new Agent(options)` with direct `generate()` and steerable `stream()` execution, add run IDs
  to agent responses and observer starts, remove the prompt-request API and request subpath, remove
  singular builder registrations, and remove agent event stores in favor of observability integrations.
  Unify direct model calls around input-first completion, image, speech, and transcription functions,
  share retry options across agents and model calls, internalize request builders, and rename the
  pipeline agent stage to `agent()`. Rename `createTool()` schema options from `input` and `output` to
  `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`. Remove `ToolSet`, `AgentBuilder.useToolSet()`, and dynamic/provider
  tool registration methods in favor of a single `tools` option that accepts executable tools,
  provider-native tools, and tool indexes. Move dynamic tool selection settings onto
  `createToolIndex()` and expose each agent's executable inventory through readonly `agent.tools`.
  Unify static documents and searchable context indexes under the `context` option, move retrieval
  settings onto `createContextIndex()`, and expose the declaration inventory through readonly
  `agent.context`. Replace controlling hooks on `new Agent()` with observational `lifecycle`
  callbacks, rename tool approval configuration to `requiresApproval`, and add resumable
  `approval_required` results and stream events through `agent.resume()`. Remove `AgentBuilder`, its
  legacy approval handlers, and the controlling hooks entrypoint; Studio keeps its question workflow
  through an internal runtime hook while bridging resumable approvals to its existing routes and events.
  Replace `PipelineBuilder` and its `build()` phase with an immutable, directly executable
  `new Pipeline({ id, inputSchema })` API while preserving typed fluent composition and graph
  inspection.
  Replace `ExtractorBuilder` with a focused `new Extractor({ model, outputSchema })` API that accepts
  text directly, uses call-level generation and retry options, and returns either parsed data or a
  detailed extraction result without exposing Agent, context, history, or builder configuration.
  Internalize the eval suite's metric factory type and consolidate direct completion and Agent request
  normalization behind one internal request factory, removing the final Core builder abstractions.
- 809d3b0: Finalize the 1.0 generation API around `generateCompletion`, `streamCompletion`, `generateImage`,
  `generateSpeech`, and `transcribe`, with one options object, `prompt` or `messages` completion
  input, schema-backed typed output, normalized result shapes, `providerOptions`, shared retries, and
  end-to-end cancellation. Move Agent retry defaults to Agent construction with explicit per-run
  inherit, disable, and replace behavior; make tool-call deltas automatic; nest stream terminal data
  under `final.result`; expose blocked and typed Agent results consistently through tools, pipelines,
  observers, React, and Studio; and rename audio-generation contracts to speech-generation.

  - @anvia/core@1.0.0-rc.0

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b9f9cc: Include request instructions in top-level and streamed child-agent generation inputs. Full-capture
  `anvia.generation.input` payloads now use `{ instructions, messages }`; input transforms receive the
  same structured object. Safe capture continues to omit the payload.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 615b767: Publish the updated upstream runtime dependencies.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 36f8324: Add first-party eval CLI result handling, deterministic and abstention metrics, explicit case and
  metric totals, score direction, usage and optional cost aggregation, and negative-control
  assertions. Add optional Lens environment configuration, bundled eval setup, and run-end flushing,
  and migrate observability and Studio consumers to the richer eval result contract. Improve eval
  type safety with readonly suite definitions, metric-aware case requirements, literal-name score
  maps, contravariant reporters, suite-bound custom metrics, and explicit prompt output selectors.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a8810b: Add opt-in evaluation case payload capture with inherited redaction and size limits.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e55a792: Add first-class evaluation run identity and lifecycle reporting so Anvia Lens can group completed
  suites, compare releases, and apply quality gates.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d02b1f5: Add safe and bounded capture controls, richer generation and tool attributes, prompt and release
  context, run events, and stable evaluation result identifiers for native observability backends.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1285e70: Add provider-neutral answer relevancy, G-Eval, prompt alignment, JSON correctness,
  summarization, hallucination, faithfulness, turn relevancy, and knowledge retention metrics.
  Carry trace references through eval reporters, publish eval scores to Langfuse experiments,
  and emit OpenTelemetry `gen_ai.evaluation.result` events correlated with model traces.

## 0.2.14

### Patch Changes

- d9ac48c: Expose cumulative authoritative usage on failed agent stream events, include provider-reported usage
  from failed OpenAI Responses requests, and retain failed child-agent usage in built-in observability
  and Studio traces. Agent error event producers must now provide `usage`; unavailable provider usage
  remains empty rather than estimated.

## 0.2.13

### Patch Changes

- 433f642: Simplify optional object construction across runtime integrations without changing public behavior.

## 0.2.12

### Patch Changes

- b52c479: Persist strict JSON message metadata across UI and core message conversions while keeping it out of provider requests and model-generation trace inputs.

## 0.2.11

### Patch Changes

- f8b8538: Refactor package entrypoints into barrel exports with focused internal modules.

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 94362c9: Move @anvia/core to peer dependencies for packages that expose or consume core types, preventing duplicate private-type incompatibilities in consumer apps.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e84d775: Clean up the `@anvia/core` public import surface by keeping common app-authoring APIs on the root export, moving advanced APIs to focused subpaths, and exposing runtime agent internals through `@anvia/core/internal/agent` for Anvia integration packages.
