## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4564d2f: Prepare the synchronized Anvia 1.0 release train.

### Patch Changes

- a90416c: Classify malformed provider tool arguments as typed retryable output failures, validate all tool
  calls before execution, preserve failed-attempt usage without exposing raw arguments, and reject
  truncated, filtered, incomplete, ambiguous, or non-JSON tool-call responses across first-party
  providers. Reject blank tool arguments and non-JSON provider options instead of inventing or
  coercing values. Align `JsonObject` with runtime validation by excluding explicit `undefined`
  properties while accepting immutable JSON arrays. Apply the same strict provider-options boundary
  to completion, image, speech, and transcription calls. Require finite strict JSON for eval inputs
  and parsed results instead of coercing them. Keep streaming retries disabled after observable
  provider progress.
  Validate React composer entity data as finite strict JSON at trigger, submission, and message
  rendering boundaries.
  Require MCP tool arguments to be strict JSON objects; only an explicit `undefined` direct call
  omits the remote arguments field.
  Make client tool-part states exact: completed results retain their original input, impossible state
  combinations are rejected, and partial streamed arguments can never be replayed as model input.
- 1dfb4f3: Preserve normalized and provider-native completion finish reasons across first-party adapters,
  identify output-limit truncation before structured parsing, rebuild Agent repairs from the original
  request with omitted or bounded text-only output, and log safe per-attempt retry diagnostics through
  named observer events.
- 475ae22: Replace process-local approval continuations and Studio-only questions with JSON-safe Agent
  interactions resumed through `generate()` or `stream()`. Add first-class question tools, explicit
  interaction response message parts, linked phase-local runs, suspension-aware nested composition,
  queued steering receipts, and eval responders. Upgrade the Client protocol to v3, unify React and
  Studio interaction handling, preserve suspensions through memory, traces, and resumable streams,
  and reject unresolved interaction parts at provider boundaries.
- 640dd3c: Redesign observability around named Agent observers, explicit primary trace provenance, and
  object-only eval targets and reporter error policies. Add owned, lazy, asynchronously disposable
  Langfuse and Lens clients; make OpenTelemetry and logger observers lifecycle-free registrations;
  and preserve observer identity through client streams and Studio traces.
  Eval trace resolution now preserves observer provenance, and reporters reject traces owned by a
  different backend unless explicitly mapped. Langfuse clients use isolated tracer providers, and
  strict observer startup/terminal dispatch cleans up partial starts without duplicate terminal calls.
- a4bf9d2: Bind provider and local-model handles to explicit model IDs, make remote provider factories
  object-only, and introduce honest local loading and ownership boundaries.
- 0292ede: Accept only complete outer JSON Markdown fences as a strict structured-output compatibility
  fallback, retry Agent parsing and schema failures within the configured total-attempt budget, and
  surface phase-aware errors without embedding rejected output. Preserve nested Error cause details
  in logger observer records with bounded traversal and redact parser/schema causes that may contain
  rejected structured output.
- 4ab25bb: Expose `new Agent(options)` with direct `generate()` and steerable `stream()` execution, add run IDs
  to agent responses and observer starts, remove the prompt-request API and request subpath, remove
  singular builder registrations, and remove agent event stores in favor of observability integrations.
  Unify direct model calls around input-first completion, image, speech, and transcription functions,
  share retry options across agents and model calls, internalize request builders, and rename the
  pipeline agent stage to `agent()`. Rename `createTool()` schema options from `input` and `output` to
  `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`. Remove `ToolSet`, `AgentBuilder.useToolSet()`, and dynamic/provider
  tool registration methods in favor of a single `tools` option that accepts executable tools,
  provider-native tools, and tool indexes. Move dynamic tool selection settings onto
  `createToolIndex()` and expose each agent's executable inventory through readonly `agent.tools`.
  Unify static documents and searchable context indexes under the `context` option, move retrieval
  settings onto `createContextIndex()`, and expose the declaration inventory through readonly
  `agent.context`. Replace controlling hooks on `new Agent()` with observational `lifecycle`
  callbacks, rename tool approval configuration to `requiresApproval`, and add resumable
  `approval_required` results and stream events through `agent.resume()`. Remove `AgentBuilder`, its
  legacy approval handlers, and the controlling hooks entrypoint; Studio keeps its question workflow
  through an internal runtime hook while bridging resumable approvals to its existing routes and events.
  Replace `PipelineBuilder` and its `build()` phase with an immutable, directly executable
  `new Pipeline({ id, inputSchema })` API while preserving typed fluent composition and graph
  inspection.
  Replace `ExtractorBuilder` with a focused `new Extractor({ model, outputSchema })` API that accepts
  text directly, uses call-level generation and retry options, and returns either parsed data or a
  detailed extraction result without exposing Agent, context, history, or builder configuration.
  Internalize the eval suite's metric factory type and consolidate direct completion and Agent request
  normalization behind one internal request factory, removing the final Core builder abstractions.
- 809d3b0: Finalize the 1.0 generation API around `generateCompletion`, `streamCompletion`, `generateImage`,
  `generateSpeech`, and `transcribe`, with one options object, `prompt` or `messages` completion
  input, schema-backed typed output, normalized result shapes, `providerOptions`, shared retries, and
  end-to-end cancellation. Move Agent retry defaults to Agent construction with explicit per-run
  inherit, disable, and replace behavior; make tool-call deltas automatic; nest stream terminal data
  under `final.result`; expose blocked and typed Agent results consistently through tools, pipelines,
  observers, React, and Studio; and rename audio-generation contracts to speech-generation.
